# Midnight Mansion Login

This repo will be home to your Midnight Mansion coding interview.

## Project

This project started with [nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/nano-react-app).

- `npm install` will install dependencies (do not use Yarn if that's something you've used recently)
- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server.

## Getting Started

We've set up this repository with Typescript and Scss as they are what we use. However, if you feel more comfortable using vanilla javascript and css, feel free to ignore them. You should be able to proceed as if they are not there. We do not expect you to learn Typescript and Scss during this assessment.

Under `src` you'll find `App.tsx`, which will be your home page and where you should implement the login flow. We've provided some starter components and linked appropriate stylesheets for your convience. Feel free to add more components if you find them necessary.

## Custom port

You can use the `-p` flag to specify a port for development. To do this, you can run `npm start` with an additional flag:

```
npm start -- --port 1234
```

## Live demo

After pushing to `main`, GitHub Actions deploys the app to GitHub Pages:

**https://khushi-saxena.github.io/mm-login/**

### If deployment fails

1. Open **Settings → Pages** on the repo.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions** (not “Deploy from a branch”).
3. Re-run the latest workflow from the **Actions** tab.

The first deploy often fails until Pages is enabled; later pushes should succeed.
